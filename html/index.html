    <p>Why a re-introduction? Because JavaScript is notorious for being the world's most misunderstood programming language. It is often derided as being a toy, but beneath its layer of deceptive simplicity, powerful language features await. JavaScript is now used by an incredible number of high-profile applications, showing that deeper knowledge of this technology is an important skill for any web or mobile developer.</p>
<p>
It's useful to start with an overview of the language's history. JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's Java language — despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.</p>
<p>
Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3. It was a mostly-compatible JavaScript work-alike. Several months after that, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, a European standards organization, which resulted in the first edition of the ECMAScript standard that year. The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999, and it has stayed pretty much stable ever since. The fourth edition was abandoned, due to political differences concerning language complexity. Many parts of the fourth edition formed the basis for ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009, and for the 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015. </p>
     <pre><code>
      function makePerson(first, last) {
            return {
                    first: first,
                    last: last,
                    fullName: function() {
                    return this.first + ' ' + this.last;
             },
            fullNameReversed: function() {
            return this.last + ', ' + this.first;
            }
          };
        }
       var s = makePerson('Simon', 'Willison');
       s.fullName(); // "Simon Willison"
       s.fullNameReversed(); // "Willison, Simon"</pre></code>
    <ul>
      <li>Because it is more familiar, we will refer to ECMAScript as "JavaScript" from this point on.</li>
      <li>Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="Overview" class="main-section">
    <header>Overview</header>
    <p>JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes . JavaScript also supports functional programming — because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object.</p>
    <p>Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:</p>
    <code></code>
    <ul>
      <li>Number</li>
      <li>String</li>
      <li>Boolean</li>
      <li>Function</li>
      <li>Object</li>
      <li>Symbol</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="Numbers" class="main-section">
    <header>Numbers</header>
    <p>Numbers in JavaScript are "double-precision 64-bit format IEEE 754 values", according to the spec. This has some interesting consequences. There's no such thing as an integer in JavaScript, so you have to be a little careful with your arithmetic if you're used to math in C or Java.</p>
    <p>Also, watch out for stuff like:</p>
    <pre><code>                       0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30000000000000004;</code></pre>
    <p>In practice, integer values are treated as 32-bit ints, and some implementations even store it that way until they are asked to perform an instruction that's valid on a Number but not on a 32-bit integer. This can be important for bit-wise operations.</p>
<p>
The standard arithmetic operators are supported, including addition, subtraction, modulus (or remainder) arithmetic, and so forth. There's also a built-in object that we did not mention earlier called Math that provides advanced mathematical functions and constants:</p>
   <pre> <code>                                 Math.sin(3.5);
                                  var circumference = 2 * Math.PI * r;</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>The parseInt() and parseFloat() functions parse a string until they reach a character that isn't valid for the specified number format, then return the number parsed up to that point. However the "+" operator simply converts the string to NaN if there is an invalid character contained within it. Just try parsing the string "10.2abc" with each method by yourself in the console and you'll understand the differences better.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="Strings" class="main-section">
    <header>Strings</header>
    <p>Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization. More accurately, they are sequences of UTF-16 code units; each code unit is represented by a 16-bit number. Each Unicode character is represented by either 1 or 2 code units.</p>
<p>
If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that single character.</p>
<p>
To find the length of a string (in code units), access its length property:</p>
    <pre><code>               'hello'.length; // 5</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>There's our first brush with JavaScript objects! Did we mention that you can use strings like objects too? They have methods as well that allow you to manipulate the string and access information about the string:</li>
      <pre><code>'hello'.charAt(0); // "h"
'hello, world'.replace('world', 'mars'); // "hello, mars"
'hello'.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"</code></pre>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
    <header>Variables</header>
    <p>New variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: let, const, or var.
</p>
    <p>let allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in.</p>
    <pre><code>let a;
let name = 'Simon';</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>const allows you to declare variables whose values are never intended to change. The variable is available from the block it is declared in.</li>
      <pre><code>const Pi = 3.14; // variable Pi is set 
Pi = 1; // will throw an error because you cannot change a constant variable.</code></pre>
      <li> A variable declared with the var keyword is available from the function it is declared in.</li>
      <pre><code>var a; 
var name = 'Simon';</code></pre>
    </ul>
